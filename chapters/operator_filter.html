    <h4>Time handling</h4>
    You can think of this operator as belonging to the filtering category of operators, using time as the predicate to decide
    which events to keep. #DEBOUNCE In simple software terms, debouncing means “execute a function or some action only if
    a certain period has passed without it being called.”

    <h4>Debounce Operators</h4>
    <!-- <p>Emits a value from the source Observable only after a particular time span determined by another Observable has passed without another source emission</p> -->
    <blockquote>It's like debounceTime, but the time span of emission silence is determined by a second Observable</blockquote>

    <h4>Distinct Operator</h4>

    <pre><code class="hljs"  data-trim contenteditable>

        Observable.of(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1)
        .distinct()
        .subscribe(x => console.log(x)); // 1, 2, 3, 4
            </code></pre>


    <pre><code class="hljs"  data-trim contenteditable>
                interface Person {
                    age: number,
                    name: string
                 }

                 Observable.of< Person >(
                     { age: 4, name: 'Foo'},
                     { age: 7, name: 'Bar'},
                     { age: 5, name: 'Foo'})
                     .distinct((p: Person) => p.name)
                     .subscribe(x => console.log(x));

                 // displays:
                 // { age: 4, name: 'Foo' }
                 // { age: 7, name: 'Bar' }
                    </code></pre>
    <blockquote>Returns an Observable that emits all items emitted by the source Observable that are distinct by comparison from previous
        items</blockquote>
