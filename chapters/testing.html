         In the end, one of the main advantages of writing your programs functionally is
that you’ve organized the code in such a way that favors testability.

    <h3>FP testing approach</h3>
    <p>Most of the case that's enough!</p>
<!-- <p>We’ll begin this chapter by demonstrating that pure functions are inherently much
        easier to test than stateful functions, because they have clear inputs and predictable
        outputs—known as boundary conditions</p> -->

        <!--t
        <ul>
            <li>External state constraints us to clean/reinitiate properly between each test => also test order can directly impact the result</li>
            <li>method higly coupled with other Module...</li>
            <li>Mock some third-party dependencies</li>
            <li>Write multiple tests against the same method just to cover all the flows (too many conditional statements)</li>
            <li>idempotency trouble => that states you should be able to run the tests as many times as needed and always obtain the same results<li>
        </ul>
        => you can significantly diminish thanks to FP-->
